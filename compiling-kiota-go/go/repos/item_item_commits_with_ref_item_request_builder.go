You must have `read` access for the repository to use this endpoint.**Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.You can pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to  fetch `diff` and `patch` formats. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.To return only the SHA-1 hash of the commit reference, you can provide the `sha` custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) in the `Accept` header. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.**Signature verification object**The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:| Name | Type | Description || ---- | ---- | ----------- || `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. || `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value.
